# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

# Step 1: Start your Application

First, you will need to start install **Node modules**, and pod files.

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# using npm
pod install

# using npm
npm start

```

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
